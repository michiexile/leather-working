    "title": "Test of stitched cuir bouilli",
    "body": "2023/01/09 - Even with my previous tests of cuir bouilli, I still have many many questions for details of the process that I should ideally figure out before pouring boiling water over a fully sewn quiver. Questions such as…  How fast will the process be with the leather I’m actually intending to use for the project? (My initial tests were on scrap pieces from Slöjddetaljer in Stockholm, and they impregnate their vegetable tan leather making anything relating to wet forming much slower) How much will the leather shrink? Should I stitch it up before boiling - how will the leather react to the stitches when it shrinks and moulds with the hot water? How will the waxed cord react to boiling? Is there anything I should be wary of there?So, once I got my hands on the piece of leather I had ordered to work with, I cut off a thin sliver - about 1 cm (just under 1/2”) wide and maybe 1 dm long (around 4”). This wrapped neatly around a thimble included in my leather sewing kit, so I cut the edges straight, bevelled the long edges and carved a stitch groove along the short edges. Quick run with a spacer wheel and then 5 stabs with an awl and I’m in business. Saddle-stitch with some waxed thread got me to this cute little leather ring: The leather ring after stitching, and with the thimble fitted inside of the loop. Next, we pre-soak the leather in cool water so that the boiling step only really heats the leather. This should, according to my reading, make for a more evenly heated result. Soaking the leather ring with the thimble fitted inside. After the bubbling has stopped from the leather soaking, we move the ring (and thimble) to a new bowl and pour water straight out of a boiling electric kettle over the leather, enough to cover it. A slow count to 20 (to approximate 20 seconds) and then the leather looked plenty dark enough to pull out. Then Letting it rest on a napkin while it dries over night. Leather boiled for 20 seconds and resting to dry on a napkin. The leather ring after boiling. Top row has the thimble still inside, bottom row has the thimble removed. The resulting leather ring is hard, with a wooden sound when I tap it against the table. It does not yield much to pressing it together, but also does not crack or collapse under the pressure of my fingers. When pressing relatively hard, the ring flexes up to about 5mm or so, but quickly goes back to the moulded shape when released. The waxed thread seems to have made it through the process quite well, and there are no signs of stress on the leather from the stitches. The original stitch was pretty close to the thimble surface, but had space enough to comfortably move the thimble in and out - while the boiled leather required some pushing to pop the thimble back out again. The suede surface on the inside is dimpled from the patterning on the thimble, and feels a bit rough, "

    "body": "2022/12/29 - I used the method described in Pattern from Blender to generate a pattern for the Hedeby Quiver I’m planning to make. With a finished flattened UV-map pattern, my next step was to sanity-check the conversion - to that end, I’ve used a thick blue felt (instead of leather) and an office stapler (instead of saddle stitch/box stitch), just to see if I believe that wet forming the leather could give the entire thing the shape I’m after. The stapled up felt model quiver. While a little bit fiddly to align everything, the test quiver model came out pretty nice. All things bend and cover just as I want them to, and align so I believe that with a tiny bit of stretch in the leather I’ll get all things stitched that I need to stitch. Top down view of the felt model quiver. My main area of concern with the pattern is at the bottom, where I need the leather of the lower wedge to curl around and cup the bottom mostly on its own, wet formed into a bottom surface of the quiver. Based on the felt model, I’m feeling good about my chances of getting this right. Bottom view of the felt model quiver. This is where the wet forming will do the most work, so where I'm most concerned about it working right. "

    "body": "2022/12/29 - I want to try the boiled leather techniques - cuir bouilli - for leather hardening in my quiver project. I’ve read a number of informative sources on how to harden leather with different techniques, what to expect, what to watch for, and how to get it done:  Leatherworker. net discussion with descriptions and links David Friedman on cuir bouilli (and why not to use beeswax) Marc Carlson on cuir bouilli, with many references and quotes (through Wayback Machine) Jason Timmermans with a very extensive experimental exploration of 16 different methods (heat, mechanical, chemical) for hardening leather, with sources and with concrete tests of brittleness, ability to withstand blunt force, piercing force, cutting force, and response to high and low temperaturesJason Timmermans in particular pointed out the need for pre-soaking leather in water first (so that the thermal (or chemical) action is not simultaneous with just water penetration). With these sources in mind, I did a first test of water forming and hardening, using scrap leather from Slöjddetaljer in Stockholm. I cut three small pieces, and:  Soaked all three in cool-from-the-tap water for several minutes. At least until I could see no more bubbles forming, but even as I was poking and prodding, the leather did not seem particularly much looser or malleable than when I started. Then I  Wiped water from one piece, bending it around a candle and taping it down to keep it in place as it dried.  Put one piece in hot-from-the-tap water, keeping it submerged for about 1 minute. Then wiped the water off, bent it around the candle and taped it down.  Put one piece in water straight from the kettle (somewhere near 100ºC / 200-210ºF) and kept it in until it started darkening. Then wiped the water off, bent it around the candle and taped it down. Three pieces as they start to set. From left to right: boiled, cold water, hot water. In the process of removing dried pieces from the shaping candle. Three pieces after removing them. They keep the curl from the candle well and feel hard to the touch. From left to right: Cold water, hot water, boiled. All three pieces after this treatment will flatten out with sufficient force (easily enough that I can do it by hand), but feel stiff and hard, noticeably more than the leather piece I took them from. The boiled leather piece is quite a bit darker in shade, especially around the edges, than the other two pieces and gives a wooden crisp knocking sound when I tap it against the table while the other two pieces give duller, more leathery sounds when I tap them. Three pieces after flattening them down. I’m growing increasingly confident in wanting to use nearly boiling water to harden the leather for my quiver. "

    "title": "Making a Pattern from Blender",
    "body": "2022/12/28 - For the Hedeby Quiver, I decided to try to generate the pattern myself, with 3d-modeling and UV coordinate maps, rather than building on the approach taken by the Leather Working Reverend. I was encouraged in the ambition by the Seams to Sewing Pattern plugin by Thomas Kole. So, building on the documentation pages for the plugin, I set out learning enough blender to pull off the project. Here’s how that went: Modeling the quiverStarting state of a new Blender project. First, remove the cube (select it, and use x or an appropriate menu). Next, we will add a Capsule (and build the quiver as a chopped off and drawn out capsule shape). Cube is removed, we've put in a capsule instead. To get the sizing we want from the capsule, let’s:  rotate it by 90º around the Y-axis to stand it upright scale it by 0. 1 along the Y- and Z-axes to squeeze it translate it by 2m along the X-axis to stand it on top of the origin plane. Slender capsule shape standing on the origin. Now, it’s time to convert this from an Metaball to a Mesh so that we can go in and chop it up into the pieces we need. Select the capsule, go to the Layout context and the Object menu. Find the Convert submenu and choose to convert it to a Mesh. At this point, we could try to do something to increase the polygon count and get a smoother shape – I didn’t. Instead, now that we have a mesh it’s time to go in and carve out the pieces we want to keep. I used the Measure tool to figure out where 0. 7m tall would fall on this shape, and used that to guide my cutting of the shape. Once you know where to cut, the process I followed is to select vertices above my designated cut and remove them (and everything defined by or connected to them). I discovered doing this that I would need to subdivide the edges near my cut (so that I could cut halfway between two rows of vertices) and needed to rotate the mesh and add to my selection to get the things behind the object as well. Hold shift and keep selecting to get the things you need. Just before subdividing to find the cut edges. Edges subdivided. Speedy removal can be done by selecting in Face Select mode, and delete using the X button and choosing Face removal. Selected a bunch of faces. Selected faces deletedSelect the rest of the faces (from the other direction). The _finished_ quiver shape (next is not about _sculpting_ any more)Carving out a patternTo carve out a pattern, we will go in and create Seams. There should be a way to then use the resulting seams for pulling the shape apart, but since I couldn’t make it work, we will instead separate the seam edges ourselves afterwards. Use the Zoom and Pan controls on the right to get a close enough view of the mesh to pick out the details you need. When doing this, I quickly realized there are some clusters of vertices that are very tightly connected, so maybe to make it all easier we will start by Merging by distance. Select everything (with A), and go to Mesh -&gt; Merge -&gt; By Distance. Then open up the small popup block bottom right labeled Merge by Distance to change the settings for merging by distance. Click the &gt; symbol to open it up, and start increasing the Merge Distance until the little text-information at the bottom tells you that some (maybe 60 or so) vertices have been merged. 0. 1m works for me. Here's the state after nearby vertices have been merged together. Pick Vertex Select mode, and go through selecting vertices where you want seams between the pieces, and then use the Vertex -&gt; Connect Vertex Path (or J) to make sure you have edges everywhere you need them. Once you have all the edges in place, go to UV -&gt; Mark Seam. Starting one of the Hedeby quiver seams. Keep going, and subdivide the mesh if you need to. Most things you can do with J (connect vertex path), but some things may need for you to select, remove (with X) and then reintroduce faces (select vertices, press F to create a face spanned by them). Selected a path and go to UV -&gt; Mark SeamFollow the paths, mark the seams, all the way to the top. All seams for the Hedeby quiver in place. Now it is time to cut this surface up into the separate surface patches we need. Choose Edge Selection mode, and select any one of the Seam marked edges. Then Select -&gt; Select Similar -&gt; Seam to select all the seam edges. Then go for Mesh -&gt; Split -&gt; Faces by Edges to cut the pieces apart. You can check your work by selecting anything in one component, and pressing L to select the entire connected component. If you get just your separated patch, you’re in good shape. Select all the seam edges. Separate Faces by Edges. One connected component selected. UV Coordinate Maps to flatten pattern piecesNow we are getting close to where we can use the UV Layout engine to create pattern parts for a concrete sewing pattern for the quiver. To be able to track how the UV coordinate map interacts with the shape, we will prepare the setup a little bit first. We will need to connect UV coordinates to the surface of the model somehow, so we will start by going to the UV Editing context. On the left hand side, do Image -&gt; New and choose Generated Type to be something like Color Grid. You should see a bunch of colors and letters and numbers show up. The UV Coordinate Map grid to test coordinate mapping. Next, we move to the Shading context to connect this UV map to the object itself. In the bottom left panel (with the grid), find the button that looks like this: . Click it and choose the color grid you put in in the earlier step. Next, in the bottom right pane, find the button that looks like this: . Click New to create a new Material definition for the surface. Then, still in the bottom right panel, go to Add -&gt; Input -&gt; UV Map to create a UV Map node. Place the node somewhere to the right of the other boxes, and connect its output to the Base Color connection point in the middle box, by clicking on the little dot where it says UV and dragging over to the dot next to Base Color. Here's how we create a UV node. Connecting the nodes to each other. The quiver still does not look terribly exciting, but that’s because we have not yet connected the UV coordinate map to the mesh itself. So let’s go to Edit Mode in the top right panel (where we see the quiver model floating around) and let’s create a UV coordinate map. Press A to select the entire mesh, and then press U (or go to the UV menu), and choose Unwrap. You will get an error message about non-uniform scales, which turns out to be because we did a bunch of rescaling operations - but didn’t quite finish the operations early on. Switch to Object Mode, click on the mesh to select it, and press Ctrl+A and choose Scale (or go to Object -&gt; Apply -&gt; Scale) to apply our earlier transformations. Applying the scale so that we can successfully unwrap the mesh onto the UV coordinate plane. Then back to Edit Mode, press A to select the entire mesh, and U to choose Unwrap. Switch to UV Editing context to see the effects of doing this - you can now see the unwrapped mesh laid out on the UV plane to the left. If you find the four balls to the far right on the menu bar of the right hand panel and click the Material Preview or the Render Preview viewing mode, you can see the pieces of your mesh color in according to where they are in the UV plane. Seeing the full UV layout. You should now be able to select something (vertex, edge, face, anything) on the UV plane to the left, and use L to select an entire connected component. You can then maneuver this around the UV plane (use G to move, or R to rotate, moving the mouse to actually move and rotate). Also helpful is to go, in the left hand (UV plane) panel, to the Overlay button and select the Display Stretch option. For things like leather work, it’s probably more helpful to use the Area display mode than the Angle display mode - to see where the mesh is stretched out the most. How to display the amount of stretch in a UV mapping. You can also at this stage in the left hand panel go to UV -&gt; Minimize Stretch to see if it can come up with a better mapping of the pieces for you. Roll the scroll wheel down as far as possible to relax the mesh as much as you can. How to minimize the stretch in a UV mappingIf you are ambitious, you can start using the three hand-shaped tools at the bottom to try to reduce the stretch (get as close to blue as possible), especially for the high-curvature piece to the left. Rescale it (select something, then L for the entire thing, then S and move the mouse to try different scales) and then start moving things around where it’s still not blue. Periodically select the component (with L) and do Minimize Stretch again to see if it gets better. You will have to change the shape yourself – Minimize Stretch only moves the interior pieces around for you. Final state before export. Once you’re at a state where you are happy with the design, you can export the resulting UV coordinate map (and then use it as a sewing pattern). In the left hand panel, choose UV -&gt; Export UV Layout. In the save file dialog, make sure you select All UVs, and pick a nice export format (such as SVG). Pick directory, filename, and export it. The resulting SVG you can import into eg Illustrator or something else that you can print from, or instruct laser cutters, or however you want to use the pattern you put together. My Blender render of the intended final outcome, with leather textures in different colors to show the composition, can be seen here: "

    "body": "2022/12/28 - For my new leather project, I want to make myself a quiver. I already (write-up coming soon-ish) made my own arm bracer for my archery, but now that I have my own bow and will be buying my own arrows, I also need a quiver and a carrying case. So why not just make it myself? Better yet, why not make it myself and teach myself at least 2-3 new crafting techniques from scratch while I’m at it? The QuiverWhile the bow I’m shooting is Chinese (Manchu), I hail myself from Stockholm, Sweden – and one of my finds when preparing for this project was an archeology thesis describing archery remains at Birka outside Stockholm. Notably, a thumb-draw thumb ring was found at Birka. I’ll take that as motivation enough to pick up Viking style quivers to go with my Manchu style bow and shooting style. Reading around a bit, I settled in on a particular reconstruction project as a good baseline for me to follow, modify and extend. The reconstruction is of the quivers found in Hedeby in Denmark (and published in Willy Groenman van Waateringe: Die Lederfunde von Haithabu), and is done by Wayne Robinson, who blogged about it at The Reverend’s Big Blog of Leather. Robinson:  Describes the source and his commission Starts the work with a schematic, a pattern and a last Continues with wet moulding the leather Sew it up and moulds the pattern on the top collar Finishes the project and shows off the result Observes some bugs in the reconstruction and some fixes of the bugsThe PlanSo I’m going to do a Hedeby-inspired quiver, with wet formed leather (and I also want to play around with cuir bouilli - water-hardened leather), following Robinson’s pattern analysis and tweaking it all over. My plan is to do the bulk in 5 oz cow leather, and the collar as well as an added “lid” construction in a nice lambskin I have left over from my earlier projects (possibly getting more lambskin if it turns out I don’t have enough for this). But instead of using masking tape and a pre-made last to figure out the pattern, I can of course not keep myself from going far more high-tech with my approach. "
