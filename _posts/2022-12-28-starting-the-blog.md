Hi everyone - let's try GitHub out for a blogging platform, why don't we?

I'm launching this particular blog site in order to document my current leather working projects.
I took up some leather working in 2022, and have made an archery bracer with laser-etched copper leaf inlays and a slightly clever fastening mechanism. 
Along the way I built a web tool (also here on my GitHub) for making bracer patterns based on measurements.
