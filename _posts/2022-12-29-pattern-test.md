I used the method described in [Pattern from Blender]({% post_url 2022-12-28-pattern-from-blender %}) to generate a pattern for the [Hedeby Quiver]({% post_url 2022-12-28-hedeby-quiver %}) I'm planning to make. 

With a finished flattened UV-map pattern, my next step was to sanity-check the conversion - to that end, I've used a thick blue felt (instead of leather) and an office stapler (instead of saddle stitch/box stitch), just to see if I believe that wet forming the leather could give the entire thing the shape I'm after.

While a little bit fiddly to align everything, the test quiver model came out pretty nice. All things bend and cover just as I want them to, and align so I believe that with a tiny bit of stretch in the leather I'll get all things stitched that I need to stitch.

My main area of concern with the pattern is at the bottom, where I need the leather of the lower wedge to curl around and cup the bottom mostly on its own, wet formed into a bottom surface of the quiver. Based on the felt model, I'm feeling good about my chances of getting this right.
